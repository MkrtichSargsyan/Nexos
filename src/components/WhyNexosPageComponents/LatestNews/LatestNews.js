            <h3>Why USDâ‚® Issuances Ensures No Risks from FTX_Alameda</h3>
            <p>
              The failure of FTX/Alameda is likely to be a watershed moment in
              the history of the cryptocurrency industry. In addition to being
              one of the largest financial failures, it has set off a daisy
              chain of leveraged failures cascading through the industry. While
              there is still more to the story, and likely more counterparties
              who will emerge in the coming weeks, Tether wants to address one
              topic which has come to the surface following the failure of FTX.
